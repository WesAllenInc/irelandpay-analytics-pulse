# Ireland Pay Analytics Frontend Migration Report

## Summary
This report documents the migration of the Ireland Pay Analytics frontend from a React/Vite application using react-router-dom to a Next.js application with App Router.

## Routing Migration
The following routing components have been migrated from react-router-dom to Next.js App Router:

- ✅ `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` → `app/not-found.tsx` (Next.js 404 error page)
- ✅ Added `app/loading.tsx` (Next.js loading state)
- ✅ Added `app/error.tsx` (Next.js error boundary)

## Migration Process
1. **Identified routing issues:**
   - `src/App.tsx` used react-router-dom for routing
   - `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` used react-router-dom's `useLocation`
   - These dependencies caused build failures with Next.js

2. **Created Next.js equivalents:**
   - Implemented standard Next.js error handling components
   - Used Next.js App Router convention for file-based routing
   - Replaced `useLocation` with Next.js `usePathname`
   - Replaced `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` components

3. **Maintained existing functionality:**
   - Preserved 404 page logging
   - Ensured consistent styling with the application theme

## Next Steps
- Run the Next.js build to verify that all routing issues are resolved
- Complete the remaining audit tasks for components, design consistency, and accessibility
- Test the application to ensure all routes work correctly
- Remove unused react-router-dom dependencies from the project

## Testing Instructions
To verify the routing migration:
```bash
npm run build
```

This should complete without the previous react-router-dom errors.
